There are three types of cloud services:
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

# IaaS
- most flexible category of cloud services, provides you the maximum amount of control for your cloud resources.
- the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the hardware, network connectivity (to the internet), and physical security. 
- You’re responsible for everything else: operating system installation, configuration, and maintenance; network configuration; database and storage configuration; and so on.
- With IaaS, you’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter, but what you do with that hardware is up to you.

- ## Common scenarios : Lift and shift migration, Testing and development
# PaaS
- middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service). 
- the cloud provider maintains the physical infrastructure, physical security, and connection to the internet. They also maintain the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and business intelligence services that make up a cloud solution. 

- ## Common scenarios : Development framework, Analytics or business intelligence
# SaaS
- the most complete cloud service model from a product perspective. 
- With SaaS, you’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application. 
- **Example** : Email, financial software, messaging applications, and connectivity software 
- least flexible but easiest to get up and running. It requires the least amount of technical knowledge or expertise to fully employ.
- The cloud provider is responsible for physical security of the datacenters, power, network connectivity, and application development and patching.
- you’re responsible for the data that you put into the system, the devices that you allow to connect to the system, and the users that have access.
