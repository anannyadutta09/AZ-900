# Cloud computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of common IT infrastructure like virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking. It is not constrained by physical infrastructure as a traditional datacenter may have.

With cloud computing, the PC is in the cloud instead of physically with us. 

# Shared Responsibility model

The various responsibilities like maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens, updating software etc are shared between the Customer/Consumer and the Cloud provider.
- Cloud provider - Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity
- Consumer - data and information stored in the cloud, for access security

There are three cloud service types: 
- IaaS(infrastructure as a service) - most responsibility on the customer
- PaaS(platform as a service) - somewhere in the middle
- SaaS(software as a service) - most responsibility on the cloud provider

Consumer will always be responsible for:
- The information and data stored in the cloud
- Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
- The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

The cloud provider is always responsible for:
- The physical datacenter
- The physical network
- The physical hosts

The type of  service model will determine responsibility for things like:
- Operating systems
- Network controls
- Applications
- Identity and infrastructure

# Cloud Models

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. 
There are three main cloud models: private, public, and hybrid.
## Private
 - cloud service that is used by a single entity.
 - comes with greater cost and fewer benefits
 - eg. - Onedrive
 ## Public
