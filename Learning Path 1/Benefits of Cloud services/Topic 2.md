Some of the benefits that cloud computing offers are:

# High availability
 Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service.High availability focuses on ensuring maximum availability, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
# Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.Ability to add more resources to better handle the increased demand at peak traffic times or reducing the resources when the demand drops off.
Scaling generally comes in two varieties: **vertical** and **horizontal**.
- *Vertical* scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. 
- *Horizontal* scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.
# Reliability
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function.The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure. With a decentralized design, the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world
# Predictability
Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on **performance predictability** or **cost predictability**. 
- *Performance predictability* - Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
- *Cost predictability* - Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. 
# Security and Governance

# Manageability
There are two types of manageability for cloud computing:
## Management of the cloud
Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.
## Management in the cloud
Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources. You can manage these:
- Through a web portal.
- Using a command line interface.
- Using APIs.
- Using PowerShell.
